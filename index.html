                About Me</h1>
            <p class="md:text-[1.2rem] lg:text-[1.5rem]">Hark, fair lords and ladies! I am but a humble squire, born of
                humble beginnings but forged in
                the fires
                of battle and schooled in the ways of war.</p>

            <p class="md:text-[1.2rem] lg:text-[1.5rem]">Through tireless study and countless campaigns, I have become a
                skilled warrior of the digital realm, my
                weapons of choice being the languages of code and the tools of technology. I have served in the courts
                of kings and the councils of merchants, my counsel sought by those who seek to conquer the digital
                frontier and establish dominion over the realms of commerce and industry.</p>

            <p class="md:text-[1.2rem] lg:text-[1.5rem]">So come, good sirs and ladies, and learn of my deeds and
                accomplishments, that you may see the worth and
                value that I bring to any endeavor or enterprise. For I am a knight of the digital realm, sworn to
                defend and serve with honor and valor, until the end of my days.</p>

                Experience</h1>
            <p class="md:text-[1.2rem] lg:text-[1.5rem]">Verily, I have been a humble squire in the field of
                programming for nigh on a year, serving as a skilled artisan of the digital realm.</p>

            <p class="md:text-[1.2rem] lg:text-[1.5rem]">Through countless hours of study and practice, I have become a
                skilled journeyman of the frontend arts, honing my skills with each stroke of the keyboard and each
                click of the mouse. With my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have crafted masterpieces of
                digital design, each one a testament to my skill and dedication to my craft.</p>

            <p class="md:text-[1.2rem] lg:text-[1.5rem]">And so I stand ready, to
                serve as a defender of the digital realm, to protect and defend the noble houses of commerce and
                industry from the threats that seek to bring them low. For I am a humble squire, but one whose skills
                and dedication are unmatched, and whose valor and courage will not falter in the face of adversity.</p>
